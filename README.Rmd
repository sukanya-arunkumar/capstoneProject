## Springboard Capstone Project

Springboard Capstone Project for introduction to Data Science Course

## Problem

The goal of this project is to analyze taxi fares logs to be able to predict a trip's fare knowing the pickup location, the drop off location, the date and the time of the ride. It would also be interesting to check the fare changes compared to certain events (subway strikes, holidays, new private taxi companies like uber or lyft, weekdays vs weekends)


## Client

The analysis would allow Taxi companies to predict how fares would change considering uncontrolled events

## Data

[The yellow taxi cabs of New York](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:yellow.trips?pli=1)

## Approach

* Define all interesting variables 
* Collect yellow taxi fares data
* Clean and wrangle the data
* Analyze the fares compared to variables
* Predict future fare rides

## Deliverables

* Python & R scripts
* Paper
* Presentation
