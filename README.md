Springboard Capstone Project for introduction to Data Science Course

Problem
-------

The goal of this project is to analyze taxi fares logs to be able to
predict a trip's fare knowing the pickup location, the drop off
location, the date and the time of the ride. In addition to that, we
could compare the yellow taxi fares to the green taxi fares and see how
or if the limitations of the green taxi affect their fares. It would
also be interesting to check the fare changes compared to certain events
(subway strikes, holidays, new private taxi companies like uber or lyft,
weekdays vs weekends)

Client
------

The analysis would allow Taxi companies to predict how fares would
change considering uncontrolled events

Data
----

[The yellow taxi cabs of New
York](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:yellow.trips?pli=1)
[The green taxi cabs of New York
2014](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:green.trips_2014?pli=1)
[The green taxi cabs of New York
2015](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:green.trips_2015?pli=1)

Approach
--------

-   Define all interesting variables
-   Collect yellow taxi fares data in Python
-   Collect green taxi fares data in Python
-   Farm fingerprint both of the datasets
-   Output csv files of the sample data
-   Clean and wrangle the data in R
-   Exploratory phase
-   Analyze the datasets
-   Build a regression graph matrix (if needed, go back to the clean
    phase)
-   Predict future fare rides

Deliverables
------------

-   Python & R scripts
-   Paper
-   Presentation
